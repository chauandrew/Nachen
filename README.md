# NachenBlaster:
## UCLA CS32 Winter 2018 Project 3

NachenBlaster is a space shooter game for Windows (I have no idea about mac integration)

### How to play the game

To play the game, you just need NachenBlaster.exe, freeglut.dll,  and irrKlang.dll all in the same directory. From there, you can just open NachenBlaster.exe and the game will start running.

### Building on your own

If you want to build the game on your own, all of the game's associated files are in the NachenBlaster folder. If things don't work for you, you may need to update the asset directory string in the main file. 


Enjoy!
